    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>I've been in the business of web development since 1998.</h3>
    <p>
      In those years I have seen the web change and evolve, and I am proud to have
      been part of the early movement of web designers who championed web
      standards. During this time, I was heavily influenced by Dave Shea's
      <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">Zen Garden</a> experiment, Dan
      Cederholm's website, <a href="http://simplebits.com/">Simplebits</a>, and
      Jefferery Zeldman's

        >Designing with Web Standards</a
      >. I got hooked on the possibilities with CSS and was part of the exciting
      transition from table layouts to CSS-based design with two different
      companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the industry has matured and specialized, I’ve gone from a web generalist
      (a.k.a <i>webmaster</i>) to specializing in front end, but still keep
      current on the design side, just so I feel like I’m making some use of that
      art degree!

      I'm currently coding away as a

      Gmail, Calendar, Inbox, and the new Google Earth.
